MATLAB Code and Sample Data from 

This repository contains the MATLAB coded used to analyze a polarized light communication experiment conducted from a delaminated LCD monitor to a smartphone+polarizer receiver in outdoor daylight conditions.

Initial findings were presented at SPIE Optics and Photonics in San Diego in August 2023, ODS 2023: Industrial Optical Devices and Systems, doi: 10.1117/12.2676177
And have been further refined for submission to the SPIE jounral of Optical Engineering
